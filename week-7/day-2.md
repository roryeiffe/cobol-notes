## Project Calculations:
- Premium End Date - Policy Start Date + Tenure
    - ex: If Policy Start Date is Nov 3rd 2023 and Tenure is 3 years, then Premium End Date is Nov 3rdh 2026
- Premium Amount - Total/(tenure * 12)
    - ex: If Total is 100,000 and and tenure is 20 years, premium amount is 100,000/(20*12) = 416.67
