## Creating a PDS, creating members
- PDS is like a folder
- 3 - utilities
- 2 - Date Set
- Allocate a new PDS
    - for data set name type, make sure to set as "PDS"
- When we try to open with "E", we get "No member in data set"
    - Cannot open an empty folder
    - To create a new member, type E in the command slot on the left and then add a member name enclosed in parentheses)    
        - ex: E     ari001.rory.revat.PDS(member)
        - This works if we have members as well
    - Now that we have a member, we can hit e to open the PDS and browse the members
- When we are inside the PDS
    - We can browse members
    - Can also use s command to create a new member
        - ex: s member2
    - Use r command to rename a member
    - Use d command to delete a member
- We allocate directory blocks as 1, so we can create 5 members
    - If we try to create and save a 6th member, we get "no space in directory". 
- PS and PDS member will behave similar

### PDS Commands
- From the DSLIST menu, use Z command to compress a PDS
    - remove any unused space
    - Only works with PDS
- While within a PDS, type C next to members you want to copy
    - Hit enter to copy to a new PDS
    - If enter an destination that doesn't exist, create a new PDS and we get 2 options
        - copy attributes of current PDS
        - create new attributes
    - If destination does exist
        - can choose to replace or not to replace duplicate members
- Copy records from one file into another
    - can be a PDS member or a PS
    - Type "cut" in the command region of a file
        - Can also type "M" to specify which lines to copy
    - To paste, go to a new file, use A or B to specify after or before and then run PASTE command
- Searching for a keyword across multiple members
    - Don't want to open each member and type "F Poland"
    - Can ask a system to search a string in all of the members
    - SRCHFOR 'srch-term'
        - Will give "Found" next to members in which string resides

    - Enter options like which members to check
    - Will generate a report. Take some time to examine this report
