## Review Session
- AND/OR in sort condition
    - //* greater than 50000 less than 80000
    - INCLUDE COND=(22,6,ZD,GE,050000,AND,22,6,ZD,LE,080000)
    - //* new jersey or new york:
    - INCLUDE COND=(12,9,CH,EQ,C'NEW JERSEY',OR,12,8,CH,EQ,C'NEW YORK')
    - //* Choosing records with location as new york and salary GE 50000
    - INCLUDE COND=(12,8,CH,EQ,C'NEW YORK',AND,22,6,ZD,GE,50000)
- Can we do Sum field and include in the same card?
    - Can do sort field, then sum field, and then include
- Difference between PDS and Library?
    - Library is for object code, system readable, not user readable
    - PDS to create and store jobs
- When the number of members exceeds space in directory, will get error "No space in directory"
- Two types of data set
    - File - Physical Sequential (PS)
        - Name of the file, broken into qualifiers (not extensions)
            - first qualifier is user id
        - Space Units
            - Tracks, Cylinders, Bytes, KB, MB
            - Commonly use tracks
            - Primary Quantity - initial amount of space to be allocated
            - Secondary Quantity - when primary is exhausted
            - How many times will secondary quantity be allocated (15 times)
                - Total 16
            - Directory Blocks - max amount of members for PDS
                - N X 6 - 1
        - Record Length
            - Maximum record length - 32 KB
            - Normally use 80 for jobs/cobol programs
        - Block Size
            - Must be in multiples of record length
        - Record Format
            - Normally use FB
        - Dataset Organization Type
            - Empty for PS
            - PO for PDS
    - Folder - Partitioned Data Set (PDS)
- Job - a collection of steps/tasks that the user wants the system to perform
    - Job Card
    - Job Step, EXEC statement
        - Max 255 steps in a job
        - 
    - DD Statements
        - Max 3273
        - SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=* (requesting to be put in SPOOL)
        - SYSOUT DD SYSOUT=* (mandatory for SORT utility)
        - SYSIN DD * (where we write sort fields, sum fields, etc.)
- Imagine we have 3 steps, steps 1,2, and 3
    - Want the system to not execute step 1 but just execute steps 2 and 3?
        - Use parameter restart and set it to step that you want to execute from
- Imagine we have 3 steps, only want step 2 to happen
    - Restart parameter, set to step 2
    - Add a null statement after step 2 (just 2 slashes), signifying the end of the job
- How to test if job has syntax errors?
    - TYPRUN = scan
- What is a procedure?
    - Pre-defined step that you can call later
    - Re-usable chunk of steps that can be invoked
    - Types of procedures?
        - INSTREAM
            - Written within the job that's using it
        - CATALOG
            - Defined in a separate member and can be called from anywhere
            - Call by the member name
- Overriding DD Statements
- Backward Reference?
    - Parameter DD name refers to a previous DD name
    - *.DDNAME or *.STEPNAME.DDNAME if from different step
- Empty File Handling Technique
    - Count(1)
- Pre-Deletion Technique


## Sort Utility
- Reformatting
    - Reorganizing the fields in the output
    - Picking and Choosing the fields to the output
    - Arithmetic Operations
    - Introducing new fields in the output
- Four Different Syntaxes:
    - INREC Fields -> list all the fields that you need (the fields that are not mentioned will not be brought to the output file)
        - INREC will act before sorting
    - INREC Overlay -> by default, all of the fields will be brought to the output
        - INREC will act before sorting
    - OUTREC Fields -> list all the fields that you need (the fields that are not mentioned will not be brought to the output file)
        - OUTREC will happen after sorting
    - OUTREC Overlay -> by default, all of the fields will be brought to the output
        - OUTREC will happen after sorting
    - OUTREC FIELDS=(POS IN THE OUTPUT:STPOS OF THE FIELD YOU WANT,LENGTH, STPOS, LENGTH, etc...)
- Arithmetic Operations
    - OUTREC FIELDS=()
        - ADD,MUL,SUB,DIV
- Splitting records from a single file to multiple output files
    - SORTIN DD
    - SORTOUT DD
    - When more than 1 output files -> SORTOF01, SORTOF02, ETC.
    - Split based on what?
        - Value in a column
            - // JOBCARD
            - //SORTIN DD
            - //SORTOF01 DD DSN
            - //SORTOF02 DD DSN
            - // STEP1
            - SORT FIELDS=COPY
            - OUTFIL FILES=01,INCLUDE=()
            - OUTFIL FILES=02, INCLUDE=()
        - Sequence of Records
            - SORT FIELDS=COPY
            - OUTFIL FILES=01,STARTREC=1,ENDREC=2
            - OUTFIL FILES=02,STARTREC=3,ENDREC=4

## Exercise:
- Input Sample data:
- 1001 tommy chennai 80000
- Write a sort command to enerate email id for each record
    - First 3 chars of name and first 3 chars of location and the string 'revature.com'
    - Must be printed on 30th column
- Expected output:
    - 1001 tommy Channai 80000    tomche@revature.com
