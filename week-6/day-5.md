## CA11
- CA11RMS is the RESTART MANAGEMENT SYSTEM for batch processing. It is interpreted with CA7 Automated Scheduler and is actually transparent to the user. All restarts are done through CA7 which facilitates the process. All jobs will have a CA11RMS 
- Insert-RMS would be set to T (Insert-runs: Y) if CA-11 tracking is on for the job in the job definition panel
