## COBOL
### Topics to Cover Today:
- Signed Variables - Numeric:
    - PIC 9(3) -> No sign
    - 01 WS01-A     PIC S9(03) VALUE +123 A23
        - Note: Signed variable, by default, is sign leading. The sign will be combined with the leading digit with the below convention
    - 01 WS01-A     PIC S9(03) sign leading VALUE +123 A23
    - 01 WS01-B     PIC S9(03) sign trailing VALUE +123 12C
    - Convention -> +1 -> A, +2 -> B -> -1 -> j, -2 -> k ... -9 -> R, +0 -> {, -0 -> }
    - 01 WS-01-STS    PIC S9(04) sign trailing Separate VALUE 123+
    - 01 WS-01-SLS    PIC S9(04) sign leading  Separate VALUE +123
- Decimal Variables
    - Virtual Decimal Variables -> Numeric -> Arithmetic Operation - The decimal point will not be displayed: 123.456 -> 123456
        - 01 WS01-VD    PIC 9(03)V(02) VALUE 123.45
    - Physical Decimal Variables (alphanumeric) -> No arithmetic operation allowed on this variable
        - No value clause is allowed
        - Move statement is allowed
        - 01 WS01-PD    PIC 9(03).9(02)
- MOVE
    - Allocation of a value to a variable can be done in 2 ways:
        1. Value Clause - Data Division
        2. Move Statement in procedure division
            - Syntax: MOVE source TO destination-variables
- Reference Modification
    - A technique where parts of a variable can be handled individually
    - Syntax: var(stpos:length)
    - ex:
        - 01 ws01-a pic a(05) value 12345
        - 01 ws01-b pic 9(05) value 00000
        - Move ws01-a(2:3) to ws01-b(3:3)
- Figurative Constants:
    - Space, spaces, zero, zeroes, zeros, 0
- Group Items 
    - 01 - level number -> system allocates 1 page of memory in the execution region (4kb)
    - 01 - WS01-A PIC X(03) -> only uses 3 bytes of memory
    - 77 - level number - elementary data item
        - The number of bytes allocated is the number of bytes mentioned in the size clause
    - Suggest: declare one variable at 01 level number and declare all the other variables in the same page/under that 01 level number variable
    - Group Item - a variable which has member variables defined
    - 01 WS01-VARS. 
        - 02 WS02-VAR1        PIC 9(03).
        - 02 WS02-VAR2        PIC 9(04).
        - 02-49 -> represent member variables
    - Rules of group item:
        - It cannot have picture clause
        - It can have value clause
        - Values are considered to be alphanumeric
        - A group item is identified as a group item if it has variables with higher level number
        - THe member items can have their own different PIC clauses and sizes.
        - The size of a group item is calculated by adding the sizes of its members
    - Rules of a member item:
        - Must have a level number higher than its group item
        - Any higher level number if the member of its immediate previous lower level number
        - A member item can be a SUB GROUP item.
            - 01 WS01-vars. VALUE "TOMMY007USANJ991111
                - 05 WS05-NAME     PIC A(10).
                - 05 WS05-ID       PIC X(03).
                - 05 WS05-ADDRESS.
                    - 06 WS06-COUNTRY  PIC A(3).
                    - 06 WS06-STATE    PIC A(3).
                    - 06 WS06-PCODE    PIC 9(02).
                - 05 WS05-PHONE     PIC 9(4).
            - We can access each variable separately
            - LEVEL NUMBER 02-49 MUST BE MENTIONED IN MARGIN B, 12TH COLUMN OR HIGHER
