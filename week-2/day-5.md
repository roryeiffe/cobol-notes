## COBOL
### Topics to Cover Today:
- Signed Variables - Numeric:
    - PIC 9(3) -> No sign
    - 01 WS01-A     PIC S9(03) VALUE +123 A23
        - Note: Signed variable, by default, is sign leading. The sign will be combined with the leading digit with the below convention
    - 01 WS01-A     PIC S9(03) sign leading VALUE +123 A23
    - 01 WS01-B     PIC S9(03) sign trailing VALUE +123 12C
    - Convention -> +1 -> A, +2 -> B -> -1 -> j, -2 -> k ... -9 -> R, +0 -> {, -0 -> }
    - 01 WS-01-STS    PIC S9(04) sign trailing Separate VALUE 123+
    - 01 WS-01-SLS    PIC S9(04) sign leading  Separate VALUE +123
- Decimal Variables
    - Virtual Decimal Variables -> Numeric -> Arithmetic Operation - The decimal point will not be displayed: 123.456 -> 123456
        - 01 WS01-VD    PIC 9(03)V(02) VALUE 123.45
    - Physical Decimal Variables (alphanumeric) -> No arithmetic operation allowed on this variable
        - No value clause is allowed
        - Move statement is allowed
        - 01 WS01-PD    PIC 9(03).9(02)
- MOVE
    - Allocation of a value to a variable can be done in 2 ways:
        1. Value Clause - Data Division
        2. Move Statement in procedure division
            - Syntax: MOVE source TO destination-variables
- Reference Modification
    - A technique where parts of a variable can be handled individually
    - Syntax: var(stpos:length)
    - ex:
        - 01 ws01-a pic a(05) value 12345
        - 01 ws01-b pic 9(05) value 00000
        - Move ws01-a(2:3) to ws01-b(3:3)
- Figurative Constants:
    - Space, spaces, zero, zeroes, zeros, 0
- Group Items 
    - 01 - level number -> system allocates 1 page of memory in the execution region (4kb)
    - 01 - WS01-A PIC X(03) -> only uses 3 bytes of memory
    - 77 - level number - elementary data item
        - The number of bytes allocated is the number of bytes mentioned in the size clause
    - Suggest: declare one variable at 01 level number and declare all the other variables in the same page/under that 01 level number variable
    - Group Item - a variable which has member variables defined
    - 01 WS01-VARS. 
        - 02 WS02-VAR1        PIC 9(03).
        - 02 WS02-VAR2        PIC 9(04).
        - 02-49 -> represent member variables
    - Rules of group item:
        - It cannot have picture clause
        - It can have value clause
        - Values are considered to be alphanumeric
        - A group item is identified as a group item if it has variables with higher level number
        - THe member items can have their own different PIC clauses and sizes.
        - The size of a group item is calculated by adding the sizes of its members
    - Rules of a member item:
        - Must have a level number higher than its group item
        - Any higher level number if the member of its immediate previous lower level number
        - A member item can be a SUB GROUP item.
            - 01 WS01-vars. VALUE "TOMMY007USANJ991111
                - 05 WS05-NAME     PIC A(10).

                - 05 WS05-PHONE     PIC 9(4).
            - We can access each variable separately
            - LEVEL NUMBER 02-49 MUST BE MENTIONED IN MARGIN B, 12TH COLUMN OR HIGHER
- Arithmetic Operations
    - Works only for Numeric Data Type - 
        1. ADD
            - ADD 10 TO WS05-A
            - ADD WS05-A TO WS05-B
            - ADD WS05-A TO WS05-B WS05-C
            - ADD WS-5-B GIVING WS05-C
                - WS05-C = WS05-B + 10
        2. SUBTRACT
            - SUBTRACT 10 FROM WS05-A
            - SUBTRACT WS05-A FROM WS05-B
            - SUBTRACT WS05-A FROM WS05-B GIVING WS05-C
        3. MULTIPLY 
            - MULTIPLY WS05-A BY WS05-B
            - MULTIPLY 10 BY WS05-B 
            - MULTIPLY WS05-A BY WS05-C GIVING WS05-C
        4. DIVIDE
            - DIVIDE WS05-A BY WS05-B -> WS05-B(QUOTIENT)
            - DIVIDE WS05-A BY WS05-B GIVING WS05-C REMAINDER WS05-D
        5. COMPUTE (NATURAL ARITHMETIC OPERATORS)
            - C = A * B / F - 23 + 2**2
            - COMPUTE WS05-C = WS05-A * WS05-B / WS05-F - 23 + 2**2
            - COMPUTE ROUNDED
- Conditions
    - Relation Condition
        - <, LESS THAN, >, GREATER THAN, EQUALS TO , =, <=, >=
    - Sign Condition - positive, negative, zero
    - Class Condition - alphabetic, numeric, alphabetic-lower,alphabetic-upper
    - Condition-Name Condition
    - Negated Condition - Not
    - Combined Condition - AND/OR

- Evaluate is more preferred over evaluate statement
- If:
    - Syntax:
        - IF (CONDITION) THEN
            - IMPERATIVE STATEMENT(S)
        - ELSE IF (CONDITION) THEN
            - IMPERATIVE STATEMENT(S)
        - ELSE IF
        - ELSE IF
        - ...
        - ELSE 
            - IMPERATIVE STATEMENTS
        - END-IF
        - END-IF
    - However many IFs you have, you must have END-IFs
    - THERE MUST NOT BE A PERIOD ANYWHERE IN BETWEEN IF AND END-IF
        - If you give a period, the IF is terminated
    - Find the highest number:
        - IF (WS05-A > WS05-B AND WS05-A > WS05-C) THEN
            - DISPLAY 'A IS THE GREATEST'
        - ELSE IF (WS05-B > WS-05 AND WS05-B > WS05-C) THEN
            - DISPLAY 'B IS THE GREATEST'
        - ELSE 
            - DISPLAY 'C IS THE GREATEST'
        - END-IF
- Evaluate:
    - Syntax:
        - EVALUATE TRUE/FALSE/VARIABLE
        - WHEN CONDITION
            - IMPERATIVE
        - WHEN CONDITION
            - IMPERATIVE
        - WHEN OTHER
            - IMPERATIVE
        - END-EVALUATE
    - Syntax:
        - EVALUTE TRUE
        - WHEN (WS05-A > WS05-B AND WS05-A > WS05-C)
            - DISPLAY 'A IS GREATEST'
        - WHEN (WS05-B > WS-05 AND WS05-B > WS05-C)
            - DISPLAY 'B IS GREATEST'
        - WHEN OTHER
            - DISPLAY C IS GREATEST'
        - END-EVALUATE
- Loops:
    - When a certain number of statements need to be repeated for some purpose
    - Iteration Statements
    - PERFORM statements
        1. Conditional 
            - Until this condition is satisfied, repeat this statement, the loop runs
            - Inline Perform
                - When the group of statements to be iterated lies between "perform" and "end-perform" statement
                - WS05-A PIC 9(02) VALUE 5.
                - PERFORM UNTIL WS05-A > 10
                    - DISPLAY 'HI'
                    - ADD 1 TO WS05-A
                - END-PERFORM.
                - This will run 6 times
                - But, if we take out the ADD statement, we will get infinity, 722 abend code
                - WS05-A 9(02)VALUE 5
                - PERFORM VARYING WS05-A FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL WS05-A > 10
                    - DISPLAY 'HI'
                - END-PERFORM.
                - How many times will it run? 10
                - PERFORM VARYING WS05-A FROM 2 BY 3 UNTIL WS05-A > 10
                - How many times will it run? 3
                - PERFORM VARYING WS05-A FROM 10 BY -1 UNTIL WS05-A < 0
            - Out-of-the-line
                - 
        2. Unconditional
            - Doesn't check for any condition
            - Inline Perform

                - PERFORM
                    - DISPLAY 'HI'
                - END-PERFORM
                - (will perform once by default)
                - PERFORM WS01-A TIMES
                    - DISPLAY 'HI'
                - END-PERFORM
                - PERFORM WS01-A TIMES
                    - DISPLAY 'HI'
                    - ADD 1 TO WS01-A
                - END-PERFORM
